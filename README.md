## Introduction

As I approach graduation, I've come to realize that merely learning tech stacks wasn't enough; I needed to dive deeper and engage with the material more passionately. With a solid foundation in Node.js, React, and Express, I am now focusing on mastering MongoDB to complete my understanding of the MERN stack. This repository captures my journey and insights as I explore MongoDB, with the hope that it will be valuable to others. My goal is to achieve my dream job, and Iâ€™m excited about the path ahead. Enjoy exploring my journey!
